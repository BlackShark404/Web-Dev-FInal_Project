            <h2 class="section-title">Bogo's Historical Roots</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
                <p>Bogo – derived its name from a lone bogo tree or Garuda floribunda, which stood on the shore where Bogo wharf is now.
                Under its spreading shade, natives and incoming traders in sailboats loaded with goods barter each others products.
                Thus, the spot became a hub for traders and merchants as well as for nature lovers. Some of these traders stayed and
                married locals of the place.</p>

                <p>The year 1600 paved way in the founding of a settlement which was eventually transformed into a barangay where the Bogo
                Central Extension now stands. While the barangay was part of another growing community of the north (now known as the
                town of Daan Bantayan), natives enjoyed freedom of self-rule athough they continued to pay tributes and taxes to the
                chieftain of Daan Bantayan. Eventually, the barangay grew in prominence and thus was separated from Daan Bantayan and
                became known as the Town of Bogo.</p>

                <p>In January 1850 the Bishop of Cebu, appointed Spanish friar Fr. Jaime Micalot as the first parish priest of Bogo and
                decreed Saint Vincent Ferrer as the town’s patron saint. The first mass was celebrated in the hastily built chapel on
                April 5, 1850, to coincide with the death anniversary of the patron saint. This chapel was later gutted by fire and a
                new stone church was constructed at the place where the Bogo Town Plaza is now located..</p>

                <p>Around this time, the Spanish authorities in Bogo introduced civil government. Pedro Aballe became the first Cabeza de
                Barangay or mayor from 1864 to 1869. Senator Pedro L. Rodriguez, popularly known as the Grand Old Man of Bogo named one
                of the oldest streets of the town after him. In those times, a cabeza de barangay took charge of the collection of
                tributes to support the encomienda system of Spain. Later the tribute was substituted by the “papelita” (cedula) which
                the individual paid in two installments annually. A taxpayer who could not afford to pay the cost of papelita in the
                amount of P1.50 was made to work on local projects at fifty centavos a week. Because of this, a good number of
                delinquent taxpayers escaped and hid in the mountain fastness of Bogo.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Bogo City: A Modern Perspective</h2>
            <div class="history-content">
                <p>Many historic moments have transpired in Bogo ever since, but to this date the most releavant would have to be the
                proclamation of Cityhood of Bogo.</p>

                <p>During the 13th Congress (2004–2007), the House of Representatives re-adopted former Joint Resolution No. 29 as Joint
                Resolution No. 1 and forwarded it to the Senate for approval. However, the Senate again failed to approve the Joint
                Resolution. Following the suggestion of Senator Aquilino Pimentel (Senate President), 16 municipalities filed, through
                their respective sponsors, individual cityhood bills. The 16 cityhood bills each contained a common provision exempting
                it from the ₱100 million income requirement of RA 9009 –</p>

                <p>“Exemption from Republic Act No. 9009. — The City of x x x shall be exempted from the income requirement prescribed
                under Republic Act No. 9009.”</p>

                <p>On 22 December 2006, the House of Representatives approved the cityhood bills. The Senate also approved the cityhood
                bills in February 2007, except that of Naga, Cebu which was passed on 7 June 2007. These cityhood bills lapsed into law
                on various dates from March to July 2007 after President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo failed to sign them</p>
                
                <p>The plebiscite for the cityhood of Bogo was held on 16 June 2007 in which 97.82% of voters of Bogo voted for cityhood.
                Former representative Clavel Asas-Martinez announced that the cityhood of Bogo has been ratified. It became the third
                component city of Cebu province.</p>
                
                <p>Although there had been multiple times the City lost its status due to court misunderstandings and revisions, on June
                28, 2011 the Supreme Court directed the Clerk of Court to issue the entry of judgment on the cityhood case of 16
                municipalities. This entry of judgment ended the cityhood battle of the 16 cities. Thus making it finally official from
                “Municipality of Bogo” to now “City of Bogo”.</p>

                <p>Today the City of Bogo stoods as a fast growing City in the north of Cebu. Although known for its sugarcane production
                and fishery, the City has been open to commercial establishments catering the needs and wants of the locals and
                visitors. The progressing City continues to excel, continuously developing business infrastructures for livelihood and
                liesure sites for tourism. As a lumad na Bogohanon would say, “Padayon Bogo!”</p>
